# Introduction

This repository provides a framework for end-to-end UI testing using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It is structured around the Page Object Model (PoM) pattern, promoting clean and maintainable test code. Designed for developers and QA engineers, this setup ensures efficient test automation and seamless integration with CI pipelines.
